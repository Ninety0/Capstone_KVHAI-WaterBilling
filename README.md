A Capstone Project Presented to the Faculty of the College of Information Technology and Computer Studies, Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Muntinlupa.

## Project Overview
This web-based water billing system was developed to modernize the billing process in Katarungan Village. The project addresses the inefficiencies of the current manual billing system by automating water consumption calculations, improving data accuracy, and streamlining payment processes.

## Research Objectives
1. Automate the calculation of water bills
2. Implement cubic consumption forecasting to track water usage trends
3. Provide real-time announcements for residents
4. Create login portals for homeowners and renters
5. Centralize the database for improved collaboration
6. Integrate PayPal for online payments

## Key Features
### Resident Portal
- View water consumption and billing history
- Receive real-time announcements
- Make online payments via PayPal
- Partial payment functionality
- Consumption forecasting visualization

### Staff Modules
- **Water Works:** Input meter readings via mobile devices
- **Clerk:** Generate bills and monitor reading progress
- **Cashier (Online):** Process and verify online payments
- **Cashier (Offline):** Record manual payments
- **Admin:** Manage accounts, announcements, and system monitoring

### Technical Features
- Automated billing computation
- Centralized database management
- Role-based access control
- Data encryption and security measures
- Moving average forecasting algorithm
- Responsive web design
